# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The dataset contains transactions made through credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Card payments are always different when compared to former payments made by the client. In our proposed system algorithms are used for respective mentioned tasks in credit card fraud detection. • Machine Learning Algorithms (ML): Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random Forest, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, SVM, AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). • Deep Learning Algorithm (DL): Simple ANN. The credit card fraud detection data-set is downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 96 frauds out of 5099 transactions. In the dataset the positive class (frauds) account for 1.882722% of all transactions. Dataset contains columns from v1 to v28 represent anonymized features to protect sensitive information. These features are numerical values derived from the transaction data and may have different interpretations depending on the specific dataset. The column time represent the time elapsed between the first transaction and the given transaction, where it is usually represented in seconds. The amount column contains the amount used for the transaction in the dataset. The column class indicates whether the transactions are fraud or not. The task is to detect whether the transaction made is fraud or not, each transaction is categorised into one of two categories (The value 1 is for fraudulent transactions, value 0 is for nonfraudulent transactions). The aim of a credit card fraud detection project is to develop a system that can quickly and accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, protecting cardholders and financial institutions from financial losses and unauthorized activities.
